-main

	-check if the duty cycle needs to be changed
		-yes
			*a flag was set in the longer-time timer interrupt
			-for each LED
				-is the duty cycle increasing?
					-yes
						-increment the duty cycle by Delta
					-no
						-decrement the duty cycle by Delta
		-no
			*the flag is clear
		-checking duty cycle max/min
			-for each LED
				-is the duty cycle greater or equal than the maximum duty cycle?
					-yes
						-set the LED to now decrease in duty cycle
					-no
						-is the duty cycle less or equal to the Minimum duty cycle?
							-yes
								-set the LED to now increase in duty cycle
							-no
								-move on

	-applying pseudoPWM
		-if the cycle flag is set (interrupt)
			-for each LED
				-is the LEDs duty cycle greater than or equal to the cycle counter
					-yes
						-turn light on
					-no	
						-turn light off
		-increment cycle counter
		-is the cycle counter greater than or equal to MaxCycles?
			-yes
				-cycle counter is equal to 1
			-no
				-move on
		-clear cycle flag
